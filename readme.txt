Hello and welcome. 

After our last meeting on git, the officers thought it would be a good idea to give you some additional pratice with git. We have created a website with a bio page. If you wish to be entered into a drawing for $5 you just have to update the bio page with your information, do a pull request to this repository, and be present at the next meeting.
